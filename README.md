You must install the mysql2 and inquirer packages in node.js 
You can also install the console.table package to display the tables neatly, asciiart-logo to create art for the database and the dotenv package to protect sensitive information.

## Usage

- For this project I created an employee database that allows me to view and manage my employees, roles and departments.
- When I run npm start, a menu presents me with options of everything that I am able to do (view all departments, all roles, all employees, add dpeartments, roles and employees and update any employee's role.
